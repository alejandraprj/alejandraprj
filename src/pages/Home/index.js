                Hi! My name is Alejandra, and I'm a rising senior at Harvard studying computer science and physics. 
                I'm also working towards fluency in Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.
                On this website, you can learn more about my interests and experience.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I grew up in Peru and immigrated to the United States in 2014. 
                As a first-generation immigrant, 
                I have been immensely grateful for all the opportunities I have obtained.
                You may find that I have explored various fields, and I'm still finding my way through them. 
                However, I have learned that I love studying computer science and physics because they allow me to use my critical thinking skills and creativity to solve important problems. 
                There are so many ways to make a positive impact on the world, and they feel like the most natural fit for me.
                I now look forward to continue finding innovative ways to help the planet! 
                I received legal status at the end of 2022 in the U.S, so I'm eager to find what I can do. Thanks for reading!
            </p>
